<h2>Stable Releases</h2>

<p>The disk images contain frameworks for macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS development, a static library for iOS development, and the source code. 
	
<p>Usually the releases can be used on newer systems, too. For example, OCMock 3.1, built with Xcode 6.2 using the OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.2 SDKs, can also be built with Xcode 7 and its newer SDKs. 
	
<p>However, there is no guarantee that a release of OCMock can be built with versions of Xcode older than the current stable version at release.

			<p>Changes in OCMock 3.8.1:
			<ul>
				<li>Restored compatibility with Xcode 11. Please note: support of older versions
					of Xcode is not guaranteed.
			</ul>
			<p>Changes in OCMock 3.8:
			<ul>
				<li>Added support for ARM-based Macs. Unfortunately, this means that the hack to
					combine the device targets with the simulator targets no longer works. The
					binary distribution will be simulator only now.
				<li>Stubs can now fulfill XCTest expectations. This requires OCMock to link
					against XCTest; except on watchOS where it's not supported. (Dave MacLachlan)
				<li>Added two new stub actions to help with debugging. (Dave MacLachlan)
				<li>Classes can block OCMock from creating mocks. (Dave MacLachlan)
				<li>Added function to determine whether a class is a dynamically created mock
					class or a subclass of one.
				<li>Deprecated notification observer mocks. This can now be done with XCTest.
				<li>Various bug-fixes and improvements to developer experience.
			</ul>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The source code for OCMock is available on GitHub 
	<span id="cistatus"><a href="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock.svg?branch=master"></a></span>
  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock">https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock</a>

<p>It is built and tests are run by Travis CI. The current status is shown above on the right. If this isn't showing <i>passing</i>, chances are the code is currently not building correctly and we're busy trying to fix it. In all other cases, a local build from source should work.
	
<p>If you want to build OCMock from source, you must have the <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage">Carthage</a> package manager installed.
